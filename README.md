# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

# Summary
In this project, we examined dozens of people to see what bacteria we can find in a humans belly button. We used HTML, JavaScript, and Plotly to create several charts to visualize the bacteria, that matched the ID of the person. We created a drop-down menu, for you to select any persons you want to look at. The charts themselves will automatically update for you.
