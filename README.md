# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

# Summary
In this project, we examined dozens of people to see what bacteria we can find in a humans belly button. We used HTML, JavaScript, and Plotly to create several charts to visualize the bacteria, that matched the ID of the person. We created a drop-down menu, for you to select any persons you want to look at. The charts themselves will automatically update for you.

# The Horizantal Bar Graph

In this chart, you can see the Subjects IDs, the Demographic Info, and the top 10 OTUs. The Test Subject button is interactive, allowing you to select any subject you want. To give you a visualization.

# The Bubble Graph

Like the Bar Graph, This gives you a different way to view the OTU IDs. You are also able to hover your cursor over the bubbles, to see and read the bacteria corrisponding to the Test subjects IDs.

# The Guage Graph

This Guage shows you how frequent the belly buttons were washed. If one IDs belly button wasn't as clean and another, it could possibly effect the bacteria that resides in the belly button. The frequency was observed, and kept track of throughout the subjects day to day lives. Seeing what the best results where.

## Summary
The bacteria found in the subjects belly buttons where different from each other, but they were also predictiable.
